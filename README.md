Toy code for reproducing experiments from the paper:

[Continuous Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization with Correlation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221718302261)

The algortihm takes a function of to inputs and finds all the optima of one input conditional on the other input. In other words, optimize every vertical slice in the picture below!
